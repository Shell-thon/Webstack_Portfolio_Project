# Webstack - Portfolio Project

## Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

- Portfolio project

**GO!**  
Yes, it’s time to white-board, to code, to troubleshoot bugs, to re-code, to solve other bugs, to refactor, etc...

Development is not a long quiet river, but it can be really fun!

Starting today, you are building **YOUR project** - be proud of it!

## Evaluation - Show off!
After the pitch, now you will code - nice right? but don’t forget you will present it at the end (the Peer Learning Day following this project) in front of professionals and staff.

Have fun!
